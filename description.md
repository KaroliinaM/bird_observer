# The solution

<p>My solution is built on Electron framework, because it's popular for building cross-platform apps with React. I wanted use React to make the frontend, because I was familiar with it and I don't have the tools to develop a React native app. The commhnication between frontend and backend is done using Express, and the data is stored to NeDB database.</p>
<p>I was already familiar with React and Express. I learned to use Electron while doing the assignment and I feel like I don't use all it's benefits yet. I also hadn't used NeDB yet, but it was really easy. Getting started with Electron was the hardest part and I also had trouble with the packaging.</p>
<p>Next I would refactor the code and write regression tests for it. The frontend code might look a little better and the backend code is all in one file.</p>
